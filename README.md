# IslamicTimeline.com with an improved UI

This project aims to improve the UI of Islamictimeline.com 

## Basic Architecture

The site will be built upon a very basic structure which is simply a vertical array of hero components.

### The hero component

This component is built using react architecture and the aim is to make it a dynamic component such that it takes a video/image , a title and a paragraph as props (parameters) and all you need to do is call it using JSX and pass the url path to the video and the paragraph and title strings.

#### video/image prop
With some css styling this video/image prop will be put dynamically as the background of the hero component.
#### title and paragraph prop
The title prop will be an h1 (well centered and styled) for the title and the paragraph prop will be a p element that is also well centered and styled.
